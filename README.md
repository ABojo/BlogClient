# BlogClient

A blog client built for the <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/blog-api'>Odin Project Curriculum</a>.

This website communicates with the API I built for the first part of the project. Users can read posts, read comments, and post comments.
